            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Taungthutada (တောင်သူ့တံတား) was started in
            September, 2019 with the initial aim to increase the information
            access for farmers in Southern Shan State. All of us are primarily
            from farming families and eager to serve the farmers as much as we
            can. <br />
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; With the belief of “ Those who feed us,
            need us”, we started working on the idea by meeting through
            chit-chat over coffee on Saturdays and online discussions at night.
            Since then, TTTD has created a Facebook Page, talked to and
            conducted research for farmers, and created agri information
            contents in an easy language for the Shan Farmers. In three month,
            the team has participated at ASEAN level boot camp and we have
            served farmers as follows:

          <p className="text-md lg:text-lg">
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Since the beginning, TTTD team wanted to go
            into fields and meet farmers, learn about their problems and solve
            them with the concept of “ Solving Together With Farmer -{" "}
            <span className="font-pyidaungsu text-center">
              တောင်သူများနှင့်အတူပူးပေါင်းပြီးကူညီဖြေရှင်းခြင်း ”
            </span>
          </p>

          <p className="text-md lg:text-lg">
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Therefore, at the beginning of year 2020,
            the team put a question of “ What if we start the a field work in
            Taunggyi to do a feasibility and impact study about farmers&apos;
            livelihoods?” We partnered with “ E-commerce Platform “ to be a
            supplier for Shan Vegetables & Fruits and growers for the crops such
            as Pumpkin (Pyit Taing Htaung), Baby Kale and Sweet Violet Waxy Corn
            from East-West Seeds. For the finance, the team collected money from
            the core members to start its own field opera work and aimed to run
            as a social business in the region.
          </p>
          <p className="text-md lg:text-lg">
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;We did not achieve all of our goals, but
            achieved some positive outcomes: the team could serve the Chayote &
            Kale farmers for market linkage, we conducted to improve the
            operation and expansion of the farmers&apos; market and explored new
            ideas to improve the socio economic development of farmer families
            in Shan.
